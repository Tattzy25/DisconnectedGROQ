    prompt: `A race where 3 logos go from left to right. Each logo is on a separate row, but it's a snug fit. Make sure the logos are not overlapping and the page width is used.
				
The logos should have rounded corners. Make them 48px. The text should appear once the Groq logo is at the finish line. 

Only the Groq logo should STOP before the finish line, then we stop updating the position of the other logos.

Use pure JavaScript for the animation.

As a funny joke, put the logos of Cerebras and SambaNova upside down using CSS transforms.

SambaNova (https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/y85yyhlbrxjtcow3u9es)

Make sure it is correct JavaScript, you are an expert coder.

Make sure Groq, SambaNova, Cerabras, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel are all represented. Speeds between 0.2 and 1.0.

3. Each job listing should have a fake "Apply Now" button that, when clicked, reveals a silly message.

Style it to look like a modern email interface with good spacing and a clean design.
When the send button is clicked, show a fun animation or message.

Add some playful elements like emoji reactions or a fun background pattern.`,
